# Authentication Fixes Applied

## Summary
All critical authentication issues have been identified and fixed. The following files have been created/updated:

## Files Created/Updated

### 1. `supabase-auth-migration.sql` (NEW)
   - Standalone migration file for existing databases
   - Can be run independently if you already have the base schema
   - Includes all authentication-related fixes

### 2. `supabase-schema.sql` (UPDATED)
   - Now includes complete authentication setup
   - Can be used for fresh database setup
   - Includes all tables, functions, and RLS policies

### 3. `AUTH_AUDIT.md` (NEW)
   - Comprehensive audit report
   - Lists all issues found and fixes applied
   - Includes testing checklist

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Critical Fixes

1. **Created `portal_users` Table**
   - Complete table definition with all required fields
   - Proper indexes for performance
   - Foreign key relationship to `auth.users`

2. **Added Missing Fields**
   - `assigned_department` to `complaints` table
   - `assigned_department` to `appointments` table
   - `unique_code` to `appointments` table (for tracking)

3. **Created `check_portal_user_access()` Function**
   - SECURITY DEFINER function to bypass RLS recursion
   - Checks user authentication and department access
   - Handles admin privileges correctly

4. **Added RLS Policies**
   - `portal_users` table policies (public read for login, user read own)
   - Updated `complaints` policies (department-based access)
   - Updated `appointments` policies (department-based access)

5. **Inserted Initial Portal Users**
   - Pre-populated with all 7 portal users
   - Ready to be linked to auth.users via script

## Setup Instructions

### For New Database Setup

1. Run `supabase-schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - This includes everything including auth setup

2. Create auth users using one of these methods:
   - **Option A**: Run `node scripts/create-portal-users.js` (requires service role key)
   - **Option B**: Manually create users in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users

3. Link users (if using Option B):
   ```sql
   UPDATE portal_users 
   SET user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'trade@woreda9.gov.et')
   WHERE email = 'trade@woreda9.gov.et';
   -- Repeat for other users
   ```

### For Existing Database Setup

1. Run `supabase-auth-migration.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - This adds all missing pieces without duplicating existing tables

2. Follow steps 2-3 from above to create and link auth users

## Verification

Run these queries to verify setup:

```sql
-- Check portal_users table
SELECT COUNT(*) as portal_user_count FROM portal_users;

-- Check if users are linked
SELECT 
  pu.email,
  pu.department,
  pu.role_key,
  pu.is_admin,
  CASE WHEN au.id IS NOT NULL THEN '✅ Linked' ELSE '❌ Not Linked' END as status
FROM portal_users pu
LEFT JOIN auth.users au ON pu.user_id = au.id;

-- Check function exists
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'check_portal_user_access';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Portal users table exists with 7 users
- [ ] Auth users created in Supabase Auth
- [ ] `user_id` linked between `portal_users` and `auth.users`
- [ ] Can login with Amharic department name
- [ ] Can login with email address
- [ ] Admin can access admin portal
- [ ] Department users can only access their department portal
- [ ] Department users can view their department's complaints
- [ ] Department users can update their department's complaints
- [ ] Admin can view all complaints
- [ ] Logout works correctly
- [ ] Session persists across page refreshes

## Login Credentials

After setup, users can login with:

| Department (Amharic) | Email | Default Password |

**⚠️ Security Note:** Change these passwords immediately in production!

## Next Steps

1. Run the appropriate SQL file in your Supabase project
2. Create auth users (via script or dashboard)
3. Link users if created manually
4. Test login functionality
5. Update passwords for production use

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check `AUTH_AUDIT.md` for detailed issue descriptions
2. Verify all SQL was run successfully
3. Check Supabase logs for errors
4. Ensure RLS policies are enabled on all tables
